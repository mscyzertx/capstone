3,"Ever have a kid in class show up and realize it’s an exam day, then gets up and leaves in a panic?","I’m sure you’ve seen a kid like this before at the college level. Just straight up not prepared but always around? Met him a few years back, he was in 4 of my classes. He was always surprised when an exam hit, he sat next to me one day and asked if there was an exam on account of everyone having a Scantron in front of them. I told him yes, there’s an exam. He literally got up and left. Didn’t take the exam. Next exam rolls around, he seems to know what’s going on because he brings a Scantron. Only a Scantron though. No pencil, not even his backpack or anything. I luckily give him one. 

He started complaining to me a few weeks later that he was failing and the professor was out to get him. I saw him around off and on through the years. I hope he got it together. ",a1ue4l,6450,645,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/a1ue4l/ever_have_a_kid_in_class_show_up_and_realize_its/

8,An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We're Opening This Fall,"Dear faculty,

Oh, and staff. Sorry, we keep forgetting you exist. So sorry. You're like the middle child of higher education. You've been so quiet since you realized that unlike faculty we'll actually fire you for speaking up.

Many of you have expressed concern with our plans to move ahead with in-person classes this fall. I personally find the plan to be relatively simple.

All we need to do to safely and successfully reopen is require everyone to wear a mask at all times, test all students, faculty and staff for COVID-19 before fall semester starts, require all students to self-isolate for 14 days before they arrive, split most of our classes into two groups that will never meet together in-person, remove half the furniture from all of our classrooms and public spaces, dedicate entire ~~dorms~~ residence halls to housing sick students, train faculty to live stream their classes to remote students while juggling the virtual and in-person management of questions and feedback, assume students will maintain physical distance and wear masks when they're off campus, assume students won't go to any parties, prep faculty to move to remote instruction immediately if they get sick or have to self-quarantine, require faculty to designate a ""colleague on call"" to serve as their academic next of kin who'll teach their class for no additional pay if they get sick or die, rearrange foot traffic patterns in all of our buildings and stairwells, dramatically increase cleaning responsibilities for our overstretched environmental services team, completely change how we distribute food in dining halls, set the HVAC to blow as hard as possible in every building to keep air flow moving, hope our toxic work culture doesn't lead to people coming in sick despite us not updating our sick or leave policies to accommodate for a generational pandemic, and cross our fingers that we get to the point in the semester where we don't have to give refunds for housing or dining plans when we move to all online instruction anyway.

I don't see what's so complicated.

But since you all keep *insisting* on asking why we're taking such a ""risk"" in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic in a country with a negligent federal response and a bunch of morons who think this is all a hoax and that mask wearing is how Bill ""5G"" Gates will steal their rights or whatever, I'm writing to clarify the university's motivations for fall.

**Money.**

Oh my god *we're so boned* if we don't get more money.

Do you not realize how much of our funding is based on dramatically overpriced housing and food? Do you not know what an auxiliary service is? *Have you not noticed a bottle of Diet Coke is $4.50 in the cafeteria?* Do you not come to the budget meetings we schedule once a year at 6:30pm the Friday before a holiday weekend?

Our endowment is like your savings account: Woefully inadequate and incapable of saving you. If we lose that sweet, sweet housing and food money we are going to have to fire at least a third of you to keep our own jobs safe, but at least we'll have a good reason to ditch those of you with tenure we don't like because you criticized us once three years ago. I'm coming for you, *Christina*.

So buck up, cupcake. Be resilient. Double your workload so you can help us maintain the façade that opening for in-person instruction is somehow going to be safe until we hit the tuition and housing due date.

We *need you* to do all this extra work so we can get that sweet, sweet student money and stay afloat. *You* are how we are going to get through this. ~~We're going to squeeze you dry and then ask for more (NOTE: Let's remove this line before we hit send).~~ By the way, here's a website about self-care that has three broken links to in-person yoga classes from last year.

This *will* involve you spending the summer designing your course twice for both in-person and online instruction. Extra funding? Hahahahahaha Nah, but here's a webcam and the login page for Zoom. Make it work.

To answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K12 school districts are going to be starting the school year online. As such, I've directed HR to do absolutely nothing to accommodate those of you who have been audacious enough to procreate. Figure it out. We can always replace you with a grad student or post doc who's desperate enough to barely scrape by. Your call.

What? No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.

Yes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.

No, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.

Yes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff. Unrelated note: Did I mention we're changing the name of that building that's been named after a white supremacist the past 83 years? I, for one, am grateful to be a part of solving racism forever.

Where was I again? Oh yes, money.

We need money to under pay you, the staff, and the adjuncts who teach 83% of our courses. So take this mask we paid too much to put our logo on and get to work. At least until the tuition refund deadline passes.

Love,

Your University President

9,"I'm a very quiet student, so I don't have anyone to share this with outside my family, but I am graduating this week as a math major with a 3.93 GPA","Like I said, I'm pretty quiet in person, and I never bring up my grades in front of my peers, but I felt inspired to brag a little bit after seeing some other posts on this sub. Because I don't like to bring up my grades, I sometimes feel like my peers assume that I'm not too bright, since I can be a little bit socially awkward!

Being a math major, I am especially proud of this, because guys... Math is hard! I like math a lot, but it does not come easily to me, and these classes were a ton of work (My college is on a 4.0 scale). In some ways, I feel like I missed out on a lot of social opportunities by prioritizing the academic side of things, so it is a mixed bag. But, it's a huge relief to be done with these classes. I love math, but I am looking forward to never having to take another math class again!

10,Why do students have to give professors and admin slack due to the pandemic but we don't receive the same?,"May be a confusing title but:

We're in the middle of a pandemic, everyone knows that. Usual financial and health problems are worse for everyone, there's more anxiety in the air due to elections and covid, yet students don't seem to be getting any sort of recognition for the unusual times. The workload is as much as ever, no pass/fail grades, a lower quality of education online(I love online but it's still lower quality on average and everyone agrees on this)

But when it comes to problems with distance learning from the college's side(bad technology set ups, online exams not working etc), the excuse I'm given from them is that 'its a pandemic, we're trying to adjust to the new circumstances'. Well no shit so are we! You keep classes at the same difficulty, if not higher and want us to feel bad for you when you're not prepared to provide us a high quality education for literally thousands of dollars??

There are some of us who're on the other side of the world and have to live through an entirely different timezone to attend classes. I for one, spend all day sleeping and have to stay awake through the night because my professors want me to attend live classes and not just look at recorded ones.",jeqz5m,5061,390,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jeqz5m/why_do_students_have_to_give_professors_and_admin/

13,Professor locked me out from taking a quiz for showing up at exactly 8am (when class starts),"I showed up at exactly 8am (the clock literally just changed from 7:59) and when I went to open the door, the professor slammed it back against me and gave me a nasty look.

This guy lets in kids who are late but slammed the door for me, at 8am. The quiz had not even started. 

Since I had to take a 0 my quiz average dropped significantly (this is 1/3 of our grade).

I went up to him after class (he let me in after the quiz) and he told me too bad, I should’ve showed up at 7:59.

I WAS ON TIME. I feel like this is incredibly unreasonable and I do not know what to do.

Edit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. 

Edit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) 

Edit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time. But yes, I know how important timing is IRL

I’ve realized how much our environment matters when learning. I could do homework and study at home, but I did much better and actually retained information when school was at school. There’s so many distractions at home. My phone, my family talking in the background, chores, etc. 

I also feel more compelled to go on my phone because I’m at home. For example, at work I don’t even feel the need to browse my phone because I’m at work, I have things to do and customers to check out.

49,Stop looking down on people for their choice of major," I am tired of people telling me that my major is ""useless"" and that I'll never use it in the real world if I don't go to grad school. I'm tired of people judging me for spending MY money (I pay for my own college, my parents don't help out) on something that I enjoy doing. I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something ""useless"" or ""easy"" or ""low-paying"" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.

1. Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the ""useless"" majors have that you could never dream of.
2. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others ""wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?"" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can ""just do."" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a 2.2 GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.
3. Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.
4. Just because you think your major is ""hard"" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are ""easy."" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called ""easy"" majors.
5. Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because ""it's going to get me money"" and then be miserable for the next 40 years of your life.
6. You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.

In conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money. I can already see what the comments section is going to look like now: ""bUt maJOrInG in EnLIsH/tHEaTRe/mUSIc/PoliSCI/BioLOGy/whateverelsepeoplethinkisuselesswithoutgoingtogradschool Is NoT SMArt BecAUSe YoU wONt MaKE moNEy & tHEn YoU WOnt gET a JoB in THat FielD.""
