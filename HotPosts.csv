0,FAFSA/financial aid questions? Get help here!,"**All questions about federal student aid, the FAFSA, and financial aid verification must be posted on this thread.**

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.

2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.

2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**

* Create an [FSA account](https://www.fsaid.ed.gov) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Do not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",pbs6uh,297,830,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/pbs6uh/fafsafinancial_aid_questions_get_help_here/

2,"After flunking out of college twice, I finally graduated CC with a 3.8 GPA!","Long story short, I was an abysmal HS student and ended up flunking out of college twice. I figured that school just wasn‚Äôt for me, and it wasn‚Äôt until I was 29 years old that I decided to give it another shot.

I applied to a local community college as an Accounting major and I have no idea why they accepted me with my 1-point-something GPA, but they did and I‚Äôm so, so grateful for it.

I worked my ass off to finish my degree in 3 semesters‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt take any breaks. There were so many times I wanted to quit. The math classes in particular were grueling because of how terrible I am at the subject. But no matter how tired or stressed I was I kept pushing. 

I know it‚Äôs just an Associate‚Äôs Degree and that I still have a long way to go, but I‚Äôm so damn proud of myself for not only refusing to give up, but for excelling.

That‚Äôs all, really. I just wanted to share my little story in case it might inspire someone. Regardless your academic history, GPA, or age, it‚Äôs never too late.‚úåüèΩ

ETA: You folks are so awesome. Thanks so much for the award and the encouragement. I‚Äôm rooting so hard for all of y‚Äôall.",sxciwa,352,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sxciwa/after_flunking_out_of_college_twice_i_finally/

5,Is dorm life worth it?,"I (19) am going to be transferring to a 4 year college from a community college next semester (august 2022) as a junior and I have the option to live on campus, but I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôs worth it. 

I live 15 minutes away from the school with my parents, and I have my own car so I can commute myself. I‚Äôd love to do the whole ‚Äúfull college experience‚Äù thing, and this is kind of my last chance. Cost wise I could do it, with a job and some help from my parents, as I qualify for instate tuition, and fafsa will cover a good chunk of it. I‚Äôd also like the independence from my parents, but I feel like I‚Äôve already come so far, my luck is gonna run out soon. (Fafsa pretty much payed all of my college expenses while at community college, and while the cost isn‚Äôt that different for the 4-year, I‚Äôm still scared I won‚Äôt be able to pay) I qualify for some scholarships too. 

I guess all I‚Äôm asking is if dorm life is really worth it, or if I should just stay home for my last two years of college, and save the money instead.

Edit:
Ok so, a little extra info

The main reason I‚Äôm considering dorming is because of over bearing parents and a desire for independence, not necessarily because of social aspects of dorming

My school offers on and off campus housing with buildings specifically for transfer/junior students, and it‚Äôs an extra 7-10k per year depending on what type of housing you pick. They‚Äôve got 4 bedroom and 2 bedroom apartment style dorms (the two bedroom ones are shared two people to a room, the 4 bedrooms give everyone their own room) they‚Äôve also got single rooms styled dorms but that‚Äôs reserved for seniors and honor students 

Their apartments are off campus and from what I gathered were built like the average apartment building (average for the south, not New York) You can pick how many room mates depending on bedrooms per apartment, or a studio. 

If I choose to dorm it will only be for 2 years, as I‚Äôm already a junior and don‚Äôt plan on going to graduate school

However cost of living, meal plans and all that are extra costs I hadn‚Äôt thought of, and hearing some of your guys experience with dorms is making me reconsider a little more. 2 years isn‚Äôt all that long, and I can move out after school, when I‚Äôve got a stable job.",sx5l1a,196,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sx5l1a/is_dorm_life_worth_it/

10,"I hate it when professors say something is ""easy""","Literally the quickest way to make a student feel bad about themselves because they don't quite understand or it's not actually ""easy"" for them.

I was told recently during office hours for a CS class that the file and code I wrote was not needed and that I was doing it wrong and all I had to do was this and that and whatever and she ended by saying ""It's easy."" 

That made me feel like shit cause I didn't know how to do it despite it being ""easy"" and I was in a depressing mood for the rest of the day and the following day as well. 

Saying that an assignment is easy is just unnecessary. You have no idea what someone's struggles are, with the content/class **and** outside of that as well. While an assignment could technically be easy, that doesn't mean it's easy for someone to get up and sit down to do the assignment if they're struggling with their mental health, family issues etc.",swdp6l,1364,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/swdp6l/i_hate_it_when_professors_say_something_is_easy/

43,I have never struggled so much in a class.,"So I am a 2nd time college student. I'm 28 and have a double Bachelor's in Psychology and Pre-Law. Not easy.

Now I'm doing prerequisites at a community college to get into their nursing program.  I've done a couple classes, not 400 level obviously, and it's been completely fine. But my grades in these classes matter as it determines my eligibility/rank to get into the nursing program.

I am actually struggling in this microbiology course. I actually did a refresher bio course first, since I hadn't had anything since high school, and I'm 28 now. I log on to these required zoom lectures where the teacher literally only confuses me more. But I'm supposed to contribute somehow, when I can't understand what the hell she's talking about. Because it's definitely not the book.

I'm tempted to contact someone in the department to let me drop with no penalty and get a refund, because I cannot be successful in this class. I have been through multiple grueling classes for my first degree, and this is a 200-level course that I have not even retained information from. I go to do the book work, sign into class on Tuesdays and Thursdays where all of that gets wiped away, and end up using google for my quizzes.

I'm really, really frustrated because I'm doing very well in the other prerequisites for the program (anatomy and physiology), but this professor makes me feel lost and dumb. I read the concept, but then I listen to her so it becomes conveluded, and then I can't make any sense of it.

It's just hard, because I've never had a class like this before. Even though I did my prerequisites for my 4 year school at this community college and transferred. Does anyone feel like... this just isn't okay? Plus the drop and refund dates are insane, you don't have enough time to evaluate the class or professor. I'm really struggling right now.",sx90yq,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sx90yq/i_have_never_struggled_so_much_in_a_class/
44,Business Management Degree,"I‚Äôm 19 and in my second semester of 1st year in college studying business and management. I do like it for the most part but I don‚Äôt have any idea what job I can realistically get, and need someone who has gone through a similar situation to tell me straight if the degree is worth it or not. 

I‚Äôve looked into supply chain management by getting a masters in it after I graduate, then working my way up through procurement or something similar, but again is the business management route the way to go if that‚Äôs what I want?

Any help appreciated.",sx904l,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sx904l/business_management_degree/
45,Starting school soon,"So I've been out of school for about 6 years and I am entering community college in may, I'm self-conscious about how I do on my PERT test, I know it doesn't matter all that much, but I feel the necessity to try to learn everything back from highschool,. I feel like I am compromising myself by telling my self I have to get back up to par by cramming Algebra1, geometry, and Algebra2 all before I start, but also feels like so much I just sit there in awe because it feels insurmountable. I guess my real question would be, should I even have to worry about relearning on my own time? Should I just go with the flow when I start school? or even just try to do the baseline of algebra? I know I also have science, writing, and reading skills to brush up but I assume those are rather quick to pick up again.

EDIT: Im also working full time currently and plan to do so while in school",sxbxdo,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sxbxdo/starting_school_soon/
46,commute or dorm?,"I'm having trouble with deciding if I want to commute or dorm. I live 45 minutes away, depending on traffic (which often gets really bad, as the only route is through an unfinished high way that leads to the airport). The benefit would obviously be that it's cheaper. I'm not exactly ready to move out yet. But, living on campus would be cheaper than having my own apartment, and I would spend less on gas and not be late. I also wouldn't be in a situation where I had to be in a safe place, but couldn't drive (if you catch my drift). Living on campus would definitely be easier, but it would be expensive and I don't know if I'll be able to handle it. Dorm costs are about $7,020 + $300 meal plan.",sxgpqp,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sxgpqp/commute_or_dorm/

48,living on campus as a 21F transfer,"hi all I got accepted to attend one of my top choices which is super exciting but I‚Äôd really like to live on campus but could use some advice or insight. I‚Äôm a transfer student (F21) & upon doing some research about the schools‚Äô dorms, a lot of the dorms I saw are singles, and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd feel about living alone.

49,I got caught plagiarizing and didn't know.,"Hello, I had a friend write a paper for me that I was extremely too busy to write and trusted she wouldn't get me any trouble since she knows the rules and took this course a few years prior. She completely paraphrased and entire essay, it's not word for word however the ideas are not hers, she just rewrote them. I wasn't aware of this because when I put it to check plagiarism nothing came up. The teacher however found the entire original paper and wants to discuss it. How do I explain myself? I didn't plagiarize word for word, it was rewritten. but I can admit any of this. Can anyone help?",sxggeu,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sxggeu/i_got_caught_plagiarizing_and_didnt_know/
