4,"As someone with severe anxiety, I could not believe my professor took time out of his day to send me these messages. Professors like this make college so worth it.",,skch3c,2420,37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/skch3c
5,I‚Äôm a college professor taking a freshman level course at a local community college and I got a 79 on our first exam,"I am working on completing an additional k-12 teaching certification and I needed 3 credits in a certain subject to finish.  It can be any course as long as it‚Äôs in the certain subject, so I found a freshman level course being offered online by a local community college to take.  I‚Äôm only 3 weeks in and I have a new empathy for my students.

As a student, I am incredibly anxious and perfectionist.  I have two bachelors and a masters degree, both of which I received with honors.  I‚Äôm a life long learner and quite honestly very interested in the subject matter of the class and have a good background in it, so I‚Äôm not sure if I am humbled or annoyed by my first test grade.

I very honestly studied.  The professor puts up power points to read and question guides to answer along with the power points.  I read EVERYTHING she posted, and I mean everything.  There were fyi handouts and videos that I read and viewed.  I filled in the review sheets.  I went back and reviewed the sheets and power points before the test.  I printed out the power points so I could have them as reference during the test as allowed.

So I kinda feel, if you have a student who is also a teacher, with a master degree, taking your freshman level course who can only get a 79‚Ä¶.either something is wrong with the testing material or the teaching material.  Most of the questions I felt I knew with confidence but there were several that I felt were either super wordy to be confusing on purpose or I could have made a case for multiple correct answers.  I feel like I can clearly explain the material and the conclusions the professor is asking us to draw, but that is clearly not reflected in the grade.  I can not possibly imagine how a student right out of high school or brand new to college would have done well on that test.  I feel like they would be crying at the computer at the overload of information they were being asked to synthesize.

I know that not everyone gets A‚Äôs in everything.  Again, maybe just my ego is a bit bruised and I‚Äôm eating a slice of humble pie because I thought taking a freshman level course would be relatively easy for me.  I guess if you take anything from my ramble it‚Äôs to not beat your self up over not getting perfect grades all the time.  Sometimes even if you try your hardest, a 79 is the best you can get.

Little update: one of the questions I though was formatted incorrectly (like it was entered in as a single answer but should have been a multi answer) was confirmed to be incorrect by the professor and I was allowed to answer that question and gain the points there.  The professor also wrote me a nice email that once the test closes we could discuss the questions I got wrong as she felt the wording could have been tricky to understand.  So I do want to give her credit for a)responding quickly and kindly and b)being open to reflecting on the question integrity.

Other update: Thanks for everyone who commented and shared stories! I didn‚Äôt expect so many responses to my whining ha!  I have definitely learned a lot.  And yes, you can be a college professor with out a PhD.  My official title is assistant professor and I am tenure track.

Annnnddd one more update: The professor shared the class data, the class low was a 24, the mean a 67, the high a 100.  She felt two questions were not worded properly so they were thrown out.  There was also an extra credit opportunity on the test that I answered correctly, so I ended up with a 99.  Even with her throwing out two of the questions and the extra credit, more than half the class failed.",sjvjtz,2275,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sjvjtz/im_a_college_professor_taking_a_freshman_level/

15,"I hate it when professors say something is ""easy""","Literally the quickest way to make a student feel bad about themselves because they don't quite understand or it's not actually ""easy"" for them.

I was told recently during office hours for a CS class that the file and code I wrote was not needed and that I was doing it wrong and all I had to do was this and that and whatever and she ended by saying ""It's easy."" 

That made me feel like shit cause I didn't know how to do it despite it being ""easy"" and I was in a depressing mood for the rest of the day and the following day as well. 

Saying that an assignment is easy is just unnecessary. You have no idea what someone's struggles are, with the content/class **and** outside of that as well.

Edit: Thank you for all your responses, they've definitely helped me get more of a grasp on how College Socializing works lmao

I should probably add that in the University I'm attending at the moment (I'm unsure if all European universities are like this), there isn't really an emphasis put on collaboration in classes. I've never had someone just start a conversation with me and no one (at least in my classes) makes any class group chats or anything like that. My classes have basically all been a bunch of different little groups sitting amongst themselves in big lecture halls while the rest of us sit silently alone. 

At my home university in the states, things are different and I did find socializing a bit easier with sitting in more group style settings and class group chats being made. None of the in-class friendships I made really went anywhere though, it always seemed that it was more of a class acquaintance thing than a relationship where they would want to hang out outside of class.",syodxd,1310,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/syodxd/how_do_people_have_friends_in_their_lectures/

23,Hey if you're a professor.....please don't say this to your students lol,"For context, I'm a very very burnt out senior (I have a job, clubs, mental health issues, etc.) And if I wasn't graduating in May, I know that I would be dropping out or taking a gap year. Since I have zero motivation, my main goal for my classes is to just complete my assignments. Not try to get an A or anything, just get them done.  (because C's get degrees right?) It's not like I'm not trying in my classes, I'm just trying to get through them the best way that I can, and that seems to be the best way for me. Once began is half done, after all.

Anyways, one of my professors gave me half credit on my discussion board for completing my responses in approximately 5 minutes (thanks Canvas for letting him know that! Bastards) And he didn't word it in a ""hey this seems a little rushed, you ok?"" way. He was EXTREMELY condescending because I apparently didn't participate in a ""deep thoughtful discussion"" and that I treated the assignment as ""something to check off my to-do list as quick as possible"" 

I got zero feedback on my actual responses, which honestly is a little infuriating. Plus, it's not like I spent 5 minutes on the assignment....it was built off of research, watching two separate hour long lectures, and psyching myself up to actually do it. Not to mention I do 5-7 other discussion boards for my other classes each week. 

I'm a bit salty at Canvas for it's tracking capabilities, and I wish universities would use something different and better. Have y'all had similar experiences with professors grading off of what Canvas told them while ignoring the actual work you did? If so, let me know.",sna10n,1169,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sna10n/hey_if_youre_a_professorplease_dont_say_this_to/
24,Am I spoiled?,"I (20F) am currently in my 3rd year of university. I am getting my engineering degree as well as taking  the classes required to apply to medical school. 

Between school, volunteering, tutoring, and preparing for my MCAT, I truly do not have time for a job (at least not without my grades suffering).

My parents are helpful and very understanding of this. They are not rich, but do everything they can to support my financially (and in other ways too of course). I have taken out loans and received scholarships, but they still pay my phone bill, car/health insurance, and assist in my grocery budget. 

Since my sister (32) lives near by and has a family of her own, my mom will go visit her and bring me food or take my laundry sometimes (I don‚Äôt have an in-unit W/D and the communal ones are gross and burned my clothes). 

Many of my friends think I‚Äôm too spoiled for my age, but I just think this is how family is supposed to be and I hope to do the same for my future kids (assuming they are working hard and not bums).

27,A professor just called me manipulative and disrespectful,"I'm not from the USA, but in my university most exams and midterms are coordinated by the head professor of each subject, so they are the ones that decide the dates, the content, the exam format, etc. Well this semester I noticed that I had two different midterms on the same day, one from 9:00 to 11:00 am and the other one 11:00-13:00 am, so while they didn't overlap since they are being held in different buildings being on time to the second one would be impossible without finishing very early the first one. So I decided to write a formal email to both head professors, to see if anything could be done to ensure that we're able to take both exams on time, since both subjects are for second years normally the are more lenient and understanding with this stuff. The first head professor responded very quickly and told me that he couldn't do anything, the second head proffesor informed me that in this particular case she isn't the one in charge but the proffesor of our respective class is. So naturally I decided to talk to them instead, I write the same email and after a week without a response I decide talking to her directly. Here is where things escalated very quickly...

Basically she was deeply offended by the suggestion, acted like I was saying her subject was less important than the other therefore she must be the one to take on the extra work of changing It, I tried explaining that It certainly wasn't the case the other one just had said no already, and that I just wanted to see if she was open to the possibility to discuss It with the class. She then got somehow more offended and acted like I was trying to undermine her by asking first the headprofessor (again, they are the ones to deal with this stuff in most cases, how could I have known that in this case an exception was made for the midterms??), and called me manipulative for trying to talk her into changing things around (again, I just asked! No harm in asking...) especially without my peers present (I wanted the opportunity to discuss this matter in class with her permission!!). I felt incredibly humiliated and apologised many, many times for 'disrespecting her', but she was having none of It, I even ended up crying a little because I don't handle well people yelling at me and I already had a lot going on (kinda like the last drop to overflow the glass) but she just said that 'I won't be led on by any manipulative behaviour or mannerisms of yours, in any case you should be crying for the utter lack of respect you have towards me'

I feel awful, humiliated, and the worst part is that I can't avoid her classes by any means (mandatory subject, with group projects and I can't let down my teammates).

The professor loved that she spoke Spanish and they frequently have conversations that the rest of us can't understand. She does not have a textbook and claims she doesn't need one. Whenever someone pronounces something wrong, she rolls her eyes. I have noticed that, since she joined, the professor is going faster. We learned 60 terms in one class. The professor asked us if we wanted to review numbers, and the girl spoke up and said ""Absolutely not, that's too easy"" before anyone else had the chance to say anything.

I no longer want to participate much because I'm embarrassed to say something wrong. I also have 6 other classes and having 200 terms to review and memorize for one class is weighing on me. This girl is making everyone uncomfortable and I can tell we feel like we're falling behind. I'm not sure why people fluent in Spanish are allowed to take an introductory Spanish course in college. It's an easy A, sure, which is great for her, but not really teaching her anything. Our final is a conversation with the professor in Spanish as if we are talking to a patient - the girl jokingly asked if she could get it over with now. 

Should I just drop? Should I say something? I feel like the professor should understand the rest of us have little to no experience with speaking Spanish and are here to start from the beginning, but she's absolutely being influenced by the girl knowing everything.",se7fsx,890,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/se7fsx/classmate_in_intro_spanish_class_is_fluent/

Edit: does anyone know how to mute a post from a phone? i got professors in my mentions and idc about this anymore /srs

Edit 2: noone has told me how to mute this post and idk how to. i'll elaborate because im tired of hellbound academics getting defensive in the replies. 

from what's being said a lot of professors put an insane amount of info into their slides and because of this if the slides are posted then the lecture can be ignored and the student will still do well. so the slides aren't posted because they don't want the student doing well if they're not focusing on the lecture/the class itself.

the powerpoints for my classes are all rough outlines, scraps of info, diagrams, and heavily reliant on the actual lecture for the actual context. the slides cannot be used as a replacement and you will not understand anything with them alone. 

i assumed every course is set up in a way where there slides are minimalistic and work in conjunction with the spoken material. i was wrong. please shut the fuck up now",siq6k9,880,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/siq6k9/without_fail_every_professor_who_doesnt_upload/
43,Good noise cancelling headphones are one of the best investment a college student can make,"I'll be graduating this semester and I have been using some Bose 700 noise canceling headphones for the past two years ever since I transferred from my community college in a large state university and I think they are one of the best investments that a college student can make.

Pros:

* If you go to a larger school like I do, you're going to be around a lot of people who are talking/doing things whether in the library, student union, or class building. When trying to get done extra work even if you aren't listening to music can be a game changer in terms of helping you focus. These are a huge plus for long study sessions when you have noisy roommates. Even when just traveling for things they are a godsend.
* You can use them for just about anything whether listening to class lectures online or watching some class video, Netflixing, gaming, working out, talking on the phone, or just listening to music that makes it sound good with the headphones.

Cons:

* They can be expensive for a good pair and not everyone can afford them even for some Sony, Bose, or Apple airpods pro they can be $250+
* Over the ear have longer battery life that can last me half or most of the week, but they still have to be charged. Nothing that can be done at night though or other times when not being used.

Not a big list, but just wanted to make my case for them as they really are worth the money if you can spare a few hundred.",sh9wjs,865,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sh9wjs/good_noise_cancelling_headphones_are_one_of_the/

NHLALONHLE - for the name to properly fit the English language and make sense, I have to break itdown into a sentence.

The sentence/name then becomes - INHLALO ENHLE

INHLALO meaning Lifestyle, Way of life and/or Environment.

ENHLE meaning Beautiful.

PLEASE HELP ME CREATE A GOOD ENGLISH NAME AND THE MEANING OF THE ENGLISH NAME BASED ON THE  ORIGINAL NAME, NHLALONHLE.

SIDE STORY: My name is hard for non-zulus to pronounce and I hate how people call me. I remember in high school the principal asked me the meaning of my name and I just said ""it means STAY WELL"". I had never thought of the actual meaning in English until that point and immediately after I uttered STAY WELL, I thought no my name can't just mean stay well, there has to be a good meaning behind. Now that I'm in college Im being called by weird names and I hate it. Unfortunately my granny who named me has passed on and she is no more to clearly explain her perspective and the meaning.

75,I got punished for going to office hours,"Ok so I had a question on a homework assignment today and I went to my professor's office hours to, you know, ask the question.

When I arrive, there's another student there who has a problem with his grade on the LAST homework assignment. While I wait for the professor to get done with the other students, this guy asks me, what did you get for ""problem A"" on the last homework? Trying to help a fellow classmate, I open my last homework assignment, the graded version, and he compares them. For the question he was concerned about, he noticed that I got less points taken off than he did, even though we arrived at the same incorrect answer. Note, our work was not identical and we had different graders.

Unfortunately, he had to involve ME in his conversation with the professor and explained how he got a lower score than me, and so the professor asks for my name, opens my graded homework file in front of us and proceeds to take points off of MY work.

Mind you, this is before I even had any of my questions answered. So I made the effort to go to office hours, you know, since most professors encourage that, and, as a result, I get my grade lowered while I NEVER asked for my assignment to be opened/regraded.

This just feels so unfair and I don't think I will ever go back to office hours with this particular professor again.

Not to make this a sob-story, but I have depression/ocd which makes it hell for me to be proactive (getting assignments done early and going to office hours). Since I'm on academic probation, I've made big changes this semester to combat my illnesses and this just feels like a big slap across the face.

Well I took this class online because none of the on campus sections fit into my schedule. This week I did my post on topic,  and replied to two people.  Then the class kiss up replied to mine,  seemed like she wanted to argue so I ignored her, besides I already did my replies. I had another class with her before and she's that ""always has to be right"" and the best type. 

She Facebook messaged me about the discussion board mentioning that I haven't responded.  We're not Facebook friends, I barely know her. I'm positive she just searched my name and matched it with my school id picture, first and last name are by all posts, and my school id pic is on there because I never seen the point in changing it. You can also see who is in the class and their profile. 


I want to block her on Facebook now, but my friend said that I should have responded to her on the board and it's like being in the middle of a conversation and walking away. I don't see the point in continuing to discuss once I've done what's graded.  I'm weirded out that someone took classwork to my personal social media.

I almost aborted right then but for whatever reason I continued. I explained how I was also a ‚Äî- major and asked if he would like to partner up for the assignment. He stared at me and then rolled his eyes, and said in a sarcastic tone ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶‚Äù and made eye contact with me until I was like ‚Äúokay cool‚Äù and walked away awkwardly.

I was rattled and didn‚Äôt know how to react. What was this guys problem? I don‚Äôt really want to be his partner after that interaction. What should I do when I see him in class after this? I almost want to ignore him.

If he would have just declined in a respectful way, I would have no issue. Just a simple ‚Äúno‚Äù would be fine. It‚Äôs the deliberate rudeness that bothers me. I know it‚Äôs a big cruel world and no one owes me their time or kindness, blah blah blah; but seriously is a little decency too much to ask?",sdkbe6,422,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sdkbe6/a_classmate_was_rude_to_me_for_no_reason/

89,"Why do parents keep to study and work hard in grade school,but stop caring in college","Sorry. This may seem like a dumb question, but its kind of obvious to ask in my opinion.I remember seeing parents in grade school pressure their kids to study hard, pay for the best tutors, ground their kids over bad grades, buy them books etc. Its like parents happiness depended on their kids success in school.

&#x200B;

Then they seem to suddenly stop caring in college. They make their kids pay 100% of tuition(even if the parents can afford it) , don't pay for tutors, stop caring about their kids grades, major etc. I don't understand.

&#x200B;

College is make or break for ones career. They can either become a doctor/go to med school or be unemployed after college or drop out of college.Wouldn't it make more sense to not care during grade school, but actually care during college years and make the sacrifices (financial and personal) then instead? I mean someone's grades in the 8th grade rarely affect their lives.",ssphlc,411,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ssphlc/why_do_parents_keep_to_study_and_work_hard_in/
90,Starting college at 27,"I'll be attending community college at 27 this fall and it makes me nervous although pretty excited for the experience and things I'll learn, I'll be starting off at a local community college then transferring to a 2 year for engineering. 

In my early 20s I worked odd jobs eventually landing a job as an industrial electrician which got me interested in the engineering aspect thus leading me to apply and go to college this year. 

It makes me feel somewhat odd begining this at my age and considering I'll be older than most traditional students and graduating in my early thirties.

92,Someone asked me to be their partner for a project!,"This is kind of embarrassing but I wanted to share somewhere. Here seemed like an appropriate place?

Background: This is my second attempt at college, it's going better now. I finished my prereqs and I just started nursing school in January. With the pandemic/anxiety I've really struggled to make friends and connect with my classmates in the past. Nursing school has been a lot different though, I'm kind of forced to talk to my classmates in and outside of class a lot and everyone's been really nice. 

Every Friday one of the instructors sends out an announcement/rundown of the next week. I woke up, got the notification, read through it. It had information about a project and our next unit. The announcement said we could work on it by ourselves or with a partner. 

As I was reading it, I got a notification from Snapchat, it was one of my classmates. I admittedly didn't click on it for a few hours, but it's just because I thought she had sent a text to our cohort's groupchat. I opened it an hour or two later after I got to work and realized it was an individual message.

She asked if I wanted to be her partner for the assignment in the announcement! I was 100% preparing to do the project alone, I was honestly shocked someone had thought of me and wanted to be my partner. It also feels kind of good to not to be someone's second/third/etc. choice, as she texted me immediately after the announcement came out. Even stretching back into high school, I was used to doing a lot of projects and assignments alone... or awkwardly being assigned by the teacher to some preexisting group because I was the kid who couldn't find my own. 

I just wanted to share. Even though the people in my classes have been really kind and helpful, I always kind of felt like I was just blending into the background. It‚Äôs nice to feel included and valued for once :-)!",sw22jz,398,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/sw22jz/someone_asked_me_to_be_their_partner_for_a_project/
93,"Depressed at community college, while all of my peers go to excellent schools","I'm in my second semester at community college and I hate it. I hate myself for not trying in high school. While everyone around me was actually doing school work and studying, I was just smoking weed and playing video games all day. Because of my horrible grades, I had no other option but community college. But 95% of my friends and classmates have gone to amazing 4-year schools. Stanford, Columbia, Harvard, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, NYU, etc. It makes me feel like such an idiot and such a disappointment. I now have a total of 3 friends left who are at community college with me, and the rest of my HS ""friends"" I haven't spoken to since they left. And I'm just stuck in my hometown while they are all living it up at great schools.

I feel like I've completely ruined my chances of being successful. So far in community college, I have all A's which is good. But even if I continue doing well I'll only be able to transfer to a mediocre school, get a mediocre job, and live the rest of my life wishing I had actually applied myself in high school.

98,PSA: Do NOT take an internship with Southwestern Advantage,"As the title states, do not take an internship with a company known as Southwestern Advantage.

Back in September, I was really set on finding an internship. I knew a buddy who had an internship and I decided to go to one of the informative meetings about Southwestern Advantage.

They start off with ""Do you want to make 7,000-9,000 dollars during the summer?"" Well of course any broke college kid would, so I said yes. They make you take notes during this informative meeting as well. Essentially they say you'll work in Maine going door to door selling books to people from as early as 7 AM to as late as 9 PM, 6 days a week. Your day off is spent with other people in the ""internship"" on Sundays. You pay your own food, rent, and travel expenses. Mathematically speaking, if you do the numbers, the top earning sales people make barely over minimum wage on an 80 hour work week. Not only that but during this informative meeting they will make you out to feel like you're lesser than those that have taken this opportunity and it isn't exactly clear as to what their purpose is. They sell books for people that are ages 3-18 I believe.

Please, do yourself a favor, stay away. If you decide halfway through the internship that you're not exactly fit to work this terrible internship, you will end up owing the company money, somehow?",su3mjv,366,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/su3mjv/psa_do_not_take_an_internship_with_southwestern/
